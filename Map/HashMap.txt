HashMap:
=======


Java HashMap class implements the Map interface which allows us to store key and value pair, where keys should be unique.

HashMap class is found in the java.util package.

 It allows us to store the null elements as well, but there should be only one null key. Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, where K stands for key and V for value. It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface.

Key Point :-
==========

1.Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
2.Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
3.Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
4.Java HashMap is non synchronized.
5.Java HashMap maintains no order.

Signiture :-
===========

HashMap<K,V> map = new HashMap<>();
