TreeSet class:
This class is the implementation of Set and SortedSet interface.
In this implementation, objects are sorted and stored in ascending order according to their natural order.
The TreeSet uses a self-balancing binary search tree.
Java TreeSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Java TreeSet class doesn't allow null element. even a single null is also not allowed otherwise it throws
NullPointerException at runtime.
Example:
import java.util.TreeSet;
class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
TreeSet<String> ts=new TreeSet<String>();
ts.add("Delhi");
ts.add("Mumbai");
ts.add("Chennai");
ts.add("Bangaluru");
System.out.println(ts);
}
}
Output:
[Bangaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai] //In sorted order
Note: TreeSet class by default only accept the Comparable object. if we try to add any non-comparable object inside the
TreeSet object, then at runtime it will throw a ClassCastException.
